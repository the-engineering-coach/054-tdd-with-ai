# Claude Code Project Configuration

## Project Overview
Go project: the-engineering-coach/tdd-with-ai
- Data store: SQLite

## Development Workflow
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices
- Write tests before implementation
- Write the simplest code to make tests pass, including hardcoded return values if necessary
- Refactor only after tests pass
- Run tests frequently to ensure code quality
- When tests pass, commit and push changes using `git mit mb` to set the author

## Code Style
- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Write clear, idiomatic Go code

## Testing
- Use Go's built-in testing framework
- Test files should be named `*_test.go`
- Run tests with `go test ./...`
