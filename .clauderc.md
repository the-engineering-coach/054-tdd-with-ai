# Claude Code Project Configuration

## Project Overview
Go project: the-engineering-coach/tdd-with-ai
- Data store: SQLite
- Architecture: Hexagonal architecture
- Repository: git@github.com:the-engineering-coach/054-tdd-with-ai.git

## Development Workflow
- Follow double-loop TDD practices:
  1. Write a failing e2e test first
  2. Write unit tests to drive the implementation
  3. Make unit tests pass with simplest code (including hardcoded values)
  4. Return to e2e test and verify it passes
- Write tests before implementation
- Write the simplest code to make tests pass, including hardcoded return values if necessary
- Refactor only after tests pass
- Run tests frequently to ensure code quality
- Commit and push after each passing unit test using `git mit mb` to set the author
- Use SSH origin for git remote (not HTTPS)
- Use `main` branch (not `master`)

## Code Style
- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Write clear, idiomatic Go code
- Use hexagonal architecture pattern

## Testing
- Use Go's built-in testing framework with testify assertions
- Test files should be named `*_test.go`
- Run unit tests with `go test ./...` (default)
- Run e2e tests with `go test -tags=e2e` (only when explicitly requested)
- Tag e2e tests with `//go:build e2e` build tag
- E2e tests should spin up the full application and make real HTTP calls
